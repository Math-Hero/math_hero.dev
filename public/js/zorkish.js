Should he leave?  More importantly, can Charlie even make these choices or is he under the command of unseen forces.  Is some stranger at a keyboard somehwere controlling every move.  In any case, it would take far too long to walk south or east across the clearing.  There's a forest to his north and a pond to his west.";

It\'s a big pond, extending far to the south and west.  To his north, Charlie can see a house.  To his east, there\'s a large clearing.";
